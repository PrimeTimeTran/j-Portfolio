## Overview
How to scale



- ELB(EC2 Load Balancer)
  - 3 Types
    - V1, Classic Load Balancer(2009) HTTP, HTTPs, TCP
    - V2, Application Load Balancer(2016) HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
    - V2, Network Load Balancer(2017) TCP, TLS(Secure TCP) & UDP
    - Overall it is recommended to use the newer v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features
    - Set up internal(private) or external(public) ELBs
  - Benefts
    - AWS gurautenes itll be working
    - Take care of upgrades
    - Provides only a few configuration knobs
    - It costs less to setup your own load balancer but takes a lot more effort
    - It is integrated with many AWS offerings/services.

- Health Checks
  - Crucial for Load Balancers
  - Enable the LB to know if instance ti forwards traffic to are  available to reply to requests
  - Health check is done on a port & route(/health is common)
  - If the response  is not 200(OK), then the instance is unhealthy.

Load Balancer Security Groups(SG)
  - First SG allows HTTP/HTTPS from public users.
  - Second SG allows from the load balancer, with source specified.

  - Good to Know
    - 4xx client errors
    - 5xx app errors
    - 503 error means at capacity or no registered target
    - If LB cannot connect to to the app then check security group.

  - Monitoring
    - ELB access logs will log all access requests
    - CloudWatch Metric will give you aggregate statistics

## Classic Load Balancer(v1)

Supports TCP(Layer 4), HTP & HTTPS(Layer 7)
Health checks are TCCP or HTTP based
Fixed hostname

> xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com
